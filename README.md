# fluent-bit docker lables

[RU](https://github.com/jidckii/fluent-bit/blob/master/README_RU.md)

This assembly is designed to collect logs from docker / docker swarm.  
Includes a lua script(thanks @gitfool [sourse](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/1499)) that creates fields from container labels.  
Also a filter for multiline messages.
